        <h2>Poe's Law</h2>
        <p>
            Poe's Law states that without a clear indicator of an author's intention, it is often impossible to tell the
            difference between an expression of sincere extremism and a parody of such extremism.
        </p>
        <p>It is the intention of this chat application to remove this problem by adding tone to messages.</p>

        <p>Currently, tone is added to the conversation by the way of different background colours that can be 
        chosen by the user.  Users can click on the colours to see what tone was used for the message.</p>
        <p>If you have a better idea for how this can be achieved, feedback can be left by following the link
